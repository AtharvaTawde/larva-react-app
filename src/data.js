    projectTitle: "Recycle Racer Project",
    course: "Introduction to Engineering Design",
    duration: "1/22/2019 - 2/20/2019",
    objective:
      "Physically and electronically model a race car that can be made out of recyclable or previously recycled items such as paper, cardboard and certain plastics.",
    type: "group",
    description:
      "I was mainly in charge of the electronic creation of the car, which was to create and assemble the car in Autodesk Inventor, and then create all of the technical drawings for it. I was given instructions on how to create the car and also a design brief presentation to sum up the criteria and constraints necessary for the car to follow, and the reason behind why it was created. Some challenges my group and I experienced were the times we could meet with each other to physically collaborate on the project. Each person had their own life and our group struggled to find a time where all of the members could be present at one location working on the project. I was in charge of the electronic submissions and was not required to come to the meetings, while the others all played an integral role in the creation of the physical car. I also had to make sure my car met the requirements and criteria, which are listed on the rubric.",

    projectTitle: "Marble Maze Project",
    course: "Introduction to Engineering Design",
    duration: "9/1/2018 - 2/25/2019",
    objective:
      "Physically and electronically create a small board game concept for children around to age of three to play. Parts will be laser cut and the parts will be assembled together for physical prototype.",
    type: "individual",
    description:
      "I was in charge of creating everything here, from brainstorming which idea must be modeled and physically created to the design aspect of the project to make it look appealing to the user. I was given instructions on how the game needed to be built. I was also given a design brief to sum up the criteria and constraints, and the cause of the actual product and why we were distributing it. Some challenges I experienced were mostly in the Autodesk InventorÂ® modeling of the game board, where I had to economically use the limited amount of board we were given for cutting out the physical parts. Specifically for my game, I needed to find a method to interlock the barriers of the Tic Tac Toe board together and I had to strategize on the most effective ways of accomplishing that and also making sure that it fit on my game board. When the physical version of cut, I had to make sure every piece fit together and that the game was playable, without any large flaws or mistakes. I also had to make sure my marble maze (Tic Tac Toe) game board followed the requirements on the rubric.",

    projectTitle: "Solar/Hydrogen Alternative Energy Vehicle",
    course: "Honors Principles of Engineering",
    duration: "10/31/2019 - 11/15/2019",
    objective:
      "To construct, model and test a vehicle that runs on alternative fuel, and make the most efficient vehicle out of a given power input. Choice between hydrogen fuel cell and solar panels.",
    type: "group",
    description:
      "I was mainly in charge of the documentation of the car, which was to document the modifications done on the vehicle itself, including design changes to the circuitry, motor position, or actual mechanism itself. I also had to document the different power configurations tested on the car, including the car's performance output and the voltage that went in the system and the current flowing throughout the system. Overall, 6 different configurations were tested: 1 solar cell, 1 hydrogen cell, 2 solar cells in series, 2 solar cells in parallel, 2 hydrogen cells in series and 2 hydrogen cells in parallel. The goal of the project was to implement the equations and topics learned in the Electrical Engineering unit. I learned that I was more productive when in charge of the online documentation rather than being the physical solution builder of the team. I applied my knowledge of compiling information, descriptions, images, specifications of the car into one document, and mostly worked on that rather than on the car itself.",

    projectTitle: "Renewable Insulation Roof",
    course: "Honors Principles of Engineering",
    duration: "2/5/2020 - 2/19/2020",
    objective:
      "To construct, model and test an insulation roof made out of completely recyclable materials such as cardboard, paper and wool.",
    type: "group",
    description:
      "I was in charge of documentation for this project as well and brainstormed the layers that went into the making of the box. The box had a bottom layer of just aluminum foil, then cardboard on the top, felt in the center topped off by layers of aluminum foil, duct tape, cardboard and dense cotton in the box. All the group members built off of each other's ideas, so there was no decision matrix or negotiations to be made to decide the configuration of the layers of the box. All the materials used had to be thoroughly researched before implementing it on the actual design. All materials chosen, were thankfully, recyclable. One of the most important constraints of the box, however, was that all the layers had to be compressed into a 2-inch thick conglomerate slab. Our box had a maximum width of 1.9 inches, but the Log Tags (temperature interval measurement system), would not fit at the ends of the box because the screw going through the box was too short. So a new screw had to designed to hold the Log Tags in place to get accurate measurements, which I assisted on making, and then the tests ran successfully. Overall, it was not effective insulation, but it proved that insulation could be created with just household materials and trash. The goal of the project was to implement the equations and topics learned in the Thermodynamics unit. I learned that a design was at its best when it was simple, and when we implemented so many layers of cotton and felt and overstuffed the box, it created a failed product, which, in my opinion, was not satisfying. I used previous knowledge on how insulation worked as well as what I learned from the notes, such as implying practical product knowledge to expand on the layers of the box. However, the downside of creating such a densely packed box was most likely inaccurate data retrieval.",

    projectTitle: "Cookies Term Report & Presentation",
    course: "PLTW Cybersecurity",
    duration: "9/28/2020 - 10/6/2020",
    objective:
      "Write a report defining and explaining what a cookie is, how it functions, its usages and exploitable vulnerabilities. Then create an accompanying presentation to give to the class.",
    type: "individual",
    description:
      "I was in charge of everything for the result of this project, since it was an individual. The stages I took to complete this project were as follows: I had to first write the report, then extract important information out of the report and condense it down into the presentation. The requirements for the report were that it needed to be 5 pages single-spaced (12 pages double, including the title and reference pages at the beginning and end respectively), and it needed to be written in formal APA format, as most engineering and science research papers are written in. I had never written in this format before for an engineering class (I had for a science fair for which I wrote a research paper) so I had to relearn the format. Five pages seemed extremely long for a topic that could be explained in a few paragraphs, so I had to include other not-so-technical research in my paper as well, including the ethics behind an attack which could manipulate cookies and the law's take on cases like these. After the paper was done, I had to take this all down into a presentation and make it a three to four minute long presentation. I had already written my paper in separate sections, so making a slide per section seemed like a good idea for explaining each and every topic I wrote about. In the end, the project was complete, and I had never done anything at such a magnitude in such a small time frame of 8 days (to write a 12 page report and create the slide deck). I was crunched for time, but I managed to produce a result by the end of the time period allotted.",

    projectTitle: "It's A Trap",
    course: "PLTW Cybersecurity",
    duration: "9/25/2020 - 10/1/2020",
    objective:
      "Create a plan of action to secure, restore and fix the situation of a computer that has already been attacked. The plan of action would consist of 5 steps in total, each covering a different aspect of computer security and possibly a method to restore the computer to its pre-attack state.",
    type: "group",
    description:
      "I did not have a specific role in the group, since this was a very inclusive assignment, which meant that everyone was involved in all aspects to reach the final goal. The final plan of action consisted of the following five steps: Review and secure firewall rules to create greater security. Investigate and remove suspicious files. Investigate and remove downloaded files. Recover lost/deleted user files. Identify and kill suspicious processes and delete executables files. After creating the plan of action, we had to apply our plan to a test environment generated by PLTW on a remote desktop. I was in charge of doing Steps 2 and 3, which were just the removal of files. I needed to explore and search the directories for hidden, suspicious files based on when they were created, how they were created and who created them. Other non-technical skills I learned through this project was that communication was key to bringing a group project together. A mistake that our group made was that we did not exchange direct contact information, so we had to communicate via email, which was slow and unreliable. Overall, the project was informative and hands-on, although our group could have made more progress if we were more communicative.",

    projectTitle: "Hangman Create Task",
    course: "AP Computer Science Principles",
    duration: "12/3/2021 - 12/15/2021",
    objective:
      "Create a complete, fully functional hangman game following the Collegeboard's AP Create Task rubric. Incorporate both the hangman_display (returns the string the player would see after each turn) and hangman (wraps the entire game loop) functions.",

    description:
      "Using the SCRUM process to complete the project in segmented tasks, I did not have a specific role in the group; everyone was involved in all aspects to reach the final goal. The final plan of action consisted of four tasks surrounding the raw implementation the code and then modifying the code to adhere to the Create Task rubric. I mainly took charge in the raw implementation of the hangman game for the first sprint of the project, with the aim of fulfilling the base game requirements.",
